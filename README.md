**Objective**

Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions and species-wise patterns using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

**Approach**

1.Load Libraries & Dataset – Pandas for data handling, Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization.

2.Inspect Data – Check shape, columns, first 5 rows, and statistical summary.

3.Visual Explorations:

 Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs Sepal width colored by species

 Histogram: Distribution of sepal length

 Box Plot: Petal length distribution across species

**Results & Insights**

Scatter Plot shows clear clustering by species.

Histogram highlights the range and frequency of sepal lengths.

Box Plot indicates differences in petal lengths among species, useful for classification insights.
