**Objective**
Predict whether a loan applicant will default or repay using a machine learning model on the Loan Prediction dataset.

**Approach**

1.Data Cleaning – Handle missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)
2.EDA – Visualize key features (loan amount, income, education)
3.Encoding – Convert categorical data into numeric format
4.Modeling – Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
5.Evaluation – Compare models using accuracy and confusion matrices

**Results & Insights**

1.Logistic Regression: good for linear relationships, stable performance
2.Decision Tree: interpretable, captures complex patterns, may perform slightly better
3.Both models provide meaningful predictions and help assess loan risk
